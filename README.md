# Law-Connect

Connect middleware for Law.

## Purpose
Law-Connect provides a piece of Connect middleware to route HTTP requests
to Law services. It provides configurable routing on URI path and HTTP
method, as well as a `resource` helper which expands into standard CRUD
routes (modeled after the Rails `resources`[1]).

[1] http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html#crud-verbs-and-actions

## Usage
Law-Connect provides a standard Connect middleware.We expect the user to have a
collection of _already-configured_ Law services (`services`), a collection of
route definitions (`routeDefs`), and an optional object (`options` )of parameters
that control how error information is exposed in responses.

## Lifecycle
Law-Connect simply provides a constructor for a piece of Connect middleware.
It expects a fully wired-up `services` object (the output of `law.create`).

## Example
(In CoffeeScript):

```coffee
connect = require 'connect'
lawAdapter = require 'law-connect'

# Given a Connect application...
app = connect()

# The connect bodyParser middleware must be `use`'d before Law-Connect
app.use connect.bodyParser() # required!

# Given a wired-up `services` object, e.g. the result of:
#   services = law.create {services, jargon, policy}
routeDefs = load './routeDefs'

# Hide most Error information in responses
options =
  includeDetails: false
  includeStack: false

# Apply the middleware!
app.use lawAdapter({services, routeDefs, options})
```

## Error handling and HTTP status codes

Errors are passed in the first callback argument, according to the Node convention
used within Law. Errors within Law are subtypes of a `LawError` subtype of `Error`,
created with the `tea-error` library. Thus `LawError` and subtypes enrich `Error`
with a `toJSON` method and the ability to construct instances with additional
properties containing information about the error context.

By default, all error response bodies include:
- The error `message`
- All custom, service-specific properties attached to the `LawError` instance.
- The error stack trace (`stack`)

If a Law service returns an error, the HTTP response presently defaults to using a
status code of `500 Internal Server Error`.

If there was no Law service that could be matched with the request, the middleware
will return a `501 Not Implemented` HTTP response.

Otherwise, the default response is `200 OK`. Specific HTTP codes can be specified by
Law services by including a `statusCode` property in the `results` argument of the
callback, which will always be treated as metadata (and thus _not_ included in the
response body).


## Configuration

### Service Definitions
Regular route definitions are of the form:

```coffee
[
  {
    path: '/something'
    method: 'get'
    serviceName: 'indexThings'
  }
  {
    path: '/something/:id'
    method: 'get'
    serviceName: 'showThing'
  }
]
```
The values of the `serviceName` property should resolve to a wired-up Law service
when the adapter is constructed. If not, a default `noService` service will respond
with a `501` error indicating that no service is implemented.

The resource syntax uses the format:

```coffee
[
  {
    resource:
      name: 'photos'
      instance: 'photo'
  }
]
```
The `resource` key indicates that the route definition should be automatically expanded
into several regular route definitions. The `name` should be the collection name (plural),
and `instance` should be the singular name of a single member of the collection. This is
used to automatically generate reasonable service names.

Regular route definitions and `resource` route definitions can be freely interspersed within
a single route definition array, and `resources` definitions will be expanded in-place.

### Options

Optional configuration can be passed via the `options` property of the arguments
object. The current properties, which all default to `true`, are:

- `includeDetails`: Include context details attached as properties to any subtypes of `LawError`.
- `includeMessage`: Include the `Error.message` property.
- `includeStack`: Include the stack trace via the `Error.stack` property.
